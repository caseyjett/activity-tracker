My project is a little activity tracker with stock images. You can load more images or search for what you'd like to see. 


The three features that I've included are: 
* Retrieve data from an external API and display the data in your app - I used the Pexels API for stock photos.
* Create a form and save the values on the click of submit to an external file - Input from the form gets saved to the anything.db file. 
* Create a server with at least one route and connect it to your application using ExpressJS

To run the application, you'll need to run `node index.js` and then go to `localhost:3000` in your browser. 

You can see that the databases is storing new inputs by visiting `localhost:3000/all.html`
